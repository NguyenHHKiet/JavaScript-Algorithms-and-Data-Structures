// To solve this problem, you'll need to iterate through the array and consider the scenario where one element is deleted. You'll want to find the longest subarray of 1's after removing one element.
// Here's a possible JavaScript solution:
function longestSubarray(nums) {
    let maxLength = 0; // To store the maximum length of subarray with 1's
    let count = 0; // To count the number of 1's
    let deleted = 0; // To track if an element has been deleted

    let left = 0; // Left pointer for the window

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        if (nums[right] === 1) {
            count++; // Increment the count of 1's

            // Update maxLength if count is greater (length of the current window)
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, count);
        } else {
            // If a 0 is encountered
            if (deleted === 0) {
                // If no element is deleted yet
                deleted = 1; // Mark an element as deleted
            } else {
                // If an element is already deleted
                // Move the left pointer to the right of the first zero encountered
                while (nums[left] !== 0) {
                    left++;
                    count--;
                }
                left++; // Move the left pointer to the next element (right of the zero)
            }
            // Update maxLength if count is greater (length of the current window)
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, count);
        }
    }

    // Subtract 1 from maxLength if the last element is 0 and only one element was deleted
    if (nums[nums.length - 1] === 1 && deleted === 0) {
        maxLength--;
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Test cases
const nums1 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0];
console.log(longestSubarray(nums1)); // Output: 3

const nums2 = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1];
console.log(longestSubarray(nums2)); // Output: 5

const nums3 = [1, 1, 1];
console.log(longestSubarray(nums3)); // Output: 2

/*
Explanation:

The algorithm uses two pointers (left and right) to create a sliding window.
It maintains count to track the number of 1's within the current window.
When a 0 is encountered, it allows deleting only one element. If more than one element is deleted, it adjusts the window by moving the left pointer to the right of the first encountered 0, effectively shrinking the window.
It continuously updates maxLength with the maximum length of consecutive 1's observed during the iteration.
Finally, it adjusts maxLength if the last element is 0 and only one element was deleted.
